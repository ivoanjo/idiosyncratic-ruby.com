## Characters in Unicode

Unicode has come a long way and is now available in version 13.0 ([core specification](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/UnicodeStandard-13.0.pdf)). The standard defines a lot of things related to characters, however, it is not always easy to grasp what a *character* actually is. Is *«Ñ* a single character or not? What about non-Latin languages?

We will need some more fine-grained concepts to distinguish and talk about characters in Unicode:

- ***Codepoint:*** A base unit to construct *characters* from. Often this maps directly to a single *character*. Depending on the encoding, a codepoint might require multiple bytes.
- ***Grapheme cluster:*** Smallest linguistic unit, a user-perceived *character*, constructed out of one or multiple codepoints.
- ***Glyph:*** The actual rendered shape which represents the grapheme cluster

### Codepoints & Encodings

Codepoints are the base unit of Unicode: It is a number mapped to some meaning. Often this resolves to a single character:

    "\u{41}" # => "A"
    "\u{ABCD}" # => "ÍØç"
    "\u{1F6A1}" # => "üö°"

There are 1114112 (in hexadecimal: 0x110000) different codepoints. On byte-level, a codepoint can be represented in different ways, which depends on the *encoding* used. Popular encodings for Unicode are ***UTF-8***, ***UTF-16***, and ***UTF-32***, which all have different mechanisms of representing codepoints:

Codepoint   | Decimal | Glyph | Bytes UTF-8 | Bytes UTF-16LE | Bytes UTF-32LE
------------|---------|-------|-------------|----------------|---------------
**U+0041**  | 65      | `A`   | 41          | 41 00          | 41 00 00 00
**U+ABCD**  | 43981   | `ÍØç`   | EA AF 8D    | CD AB          | CD AB 00 00
**U+1F6A1** | 128673  | `üö°`   | F0 9F 9A A1 | 3D D8 A1 DE    | A1 F6 01 00
{:.table-15-15-10-20-20-X}

Here is an overview, without going into too much detail:

- ***UTF-8*** uses a dynamic number of bytes: While [ASCII characters](/56-us-ascii-8bit.html) fit into a single byte, it can use up to 4 bytes for higher codepoints.
- ***UTF-16*** uses 2 bytes, if possible, but has a 4 byte mechanism to represent higher codepoints.
- ***UTF-32*** is a direct representation of the codepoint and always uses 4 bytes, no logic is involved. It is also a little lavish, because even the largest codepoint **U+10FFFF** only uses 21 bit of information. As a consequence the last byte is always `00`.

You can visualize and learn about encodings on the command-line with the [unibits CLI utility](https://github.com/janlelis/unibits/).

The rest of this blog post will not deal with encodings and byte representations, but use codepoints as the smallest unit.

### Grapheme Clusters

A user-perceived character might be constructed out of multiple codepoints. There are a lot of *enclosing characters* (like [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic)) which get combined with the previous character to form a new one:

"AÃà" = **U+0041** "A" + **U+0308** "‚óåÃà"

An example from the Thai language:

"‡∏Å‡∏≥" = **U+0E01** "‡∏Å" + **U+0E33** " ‡∏≥"

Emoji are another example of grapheme clusters that require multiple codepoints:

"üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥"¬π = **U+1F468** "üë®" + **U+1F3FB** "üèª" + **U+0200D** "‚Äç" + **U+1F373** "üç≥"

[Ruby 2.5 introduced a convenient way](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13780) to iterate through all grapheme clusters:

    "ab‡∏Å‡∏≥cd".grapheme_clusters # => ["a", "b", "‡∏Å‡∏≥", "c", "d"]

There is also `/\X/`¬≤, a regex feature that you can use instead of the default `/./` to match for grapheme clusters instead of codepoints:

    "ab‡∏Å‡∏≥cd".scan(/./) # => ["a", "b", "‡∏Å", "‡∏≥", "c", "d"]
    "ab‡∏Å‡∏≥cd".scan(/\X/) # => ["a", "b", "‡∏Å‡∏≥", "c", "d"]

¬π Depending on the recentness of your rendering software, this is displayed as a single male cook<br/>
¬≤ This regex matcher was already introduced in earlier versions of Ruby

- [RDoc: Grapheme clusters](https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#method-i-each_grapheme_cluster)
- [Onigmo documentation: `\X`](https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo/blob/b8c3321cfdd5638c136ecff1fd139de24616a6aa/doc/RE#L117-L124)

## Normalization

<img src="images/keyboard.jpg" style="border: 1px solid #555; filter: grayscale(60%);" />

Sometimes, the Unicode standard defines multiple ways to describe the same (or a very similar) glyph. Let us revisit the example from above: the German letter "√Ñ", which is a "A" with two dots above. It is defined as codepoint **U+00C4**. At the same time, there is a mechanism to put two dots above just any letter using the *combining codepoint* **U+0308**. Combine it with "A" and you get "AÃà" - A different representation, although semantically, it is the same character.

However, sometimes you need one canonical representation of a string. This is why the Unicode consortium came up with a normalization algorithm. It is [included in Ruby's standard library](https://stdgems.org/libraries/) and required automatically. There are several types of normalization forms:

Form       | Description
-----------|------------
***NFC***  | Default. The ***C*** stands for *composed*, it uses the composed format for graphemes (if available).
***NFD***  | The ***D*** stands for *decomposed*, it uses separate codepoints for such graphemes
***NFKC*** | Like ***NFC***, but uses compatibility mode, instead of canonical mode
***NFKD*** | Like ***NFD***, but uses compatibility mode, instead of canonical mode
{:.table-10-X}

*NFC*

    "√Ñ".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+00C4"]
    "√Ñ".unicode_normalize.codepoints.map{|c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # => ["U+00C4"]

    "AÃà".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+0041", "U+0308"]
    "AÃà".unicode_normalize.codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # => ["U+00C4"]

    "A¬≤".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+0041", "U+00B2"]
    "A¬≤".unicode_normalize.codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # =>  ["U+0041", "U+00B2"]

*NFD*

    "√Ñ".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+00C4"]
    "√Ñ".unicode_normalize(:nfd).codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # => ["U+0041", "U+0308"]

    "AÃà".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+0041", "U+0308"]
    "AÃà".unicode_normalize(:nfd).codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # => ["U+0041", "U+0308"]

    "A¬≤".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+0041", "U+00B2"]
    "A¬≤".unicode_normalize(:nfd).codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # =>  ["U+0041", "U+00B2"]

*NFKC*

    "√Ñ".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+00C4"]
    "√Ñ".unicode_normalize(:nfkc).codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # => ["U+00C4"]

    "AÃà".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+0041", "U+0308"]
    "AÃà".unicode_normalize(:nfkc).codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # => ["U+00C4"]

    "A¬≤".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+0041", "U+00B2"]
    "A¬≤".unicode_normalize(:nfkc).codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # =>  ["U+0041", "U+0032"]

*NFKD*

    "√Ñ".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+00C4"]
    "√Ñ".unicode_normalize(:nfkd).codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # => ["U+0041", "U+0308"]

    "AÃà".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+0041", "U+0308"]
    "AÃà".unicode_normalize(:nfkd).codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # => ["U+0041", "U+0308"]

    "A¬≤".codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c } # => ["U+0041", "U+00B2"]
    "A¬≤".unicode_normalize(:nfkd).codepoints.map{ |c| "U+%04X"%c }
    # =>  ["U+0041", "U+0032"]

See the standard and documentation for more details, including the differences between the normalization forms:

- [Unicode¬Æ Standard Annex #15: Unicode Normalization Forms](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/)
- [RDoc: unicode_normalize](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/String.html#method-i-unicode_normalize)
- [Wikipedia: Unicode equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence)

### Special Case: Visual Confusable Characters

Even in normalization form, there are characters which look very similar (sometimes even identical):

Codepoints A            | String A | String B | Codepoints B
------------------------|----------|----------|-------------
**U+003F** + **U+003F** | `??`     | `‚Åá`      | **U+2047**
**U+0043**              | `C`      | `–°`      | **U+0421**
**U+0031**              | `1`      | `l`      | **U+006C**

The record holder is **LATIN SMALL LETTER O** which is currently linked to 75 other characters that it could be confused with:

<div style="font-size: 130%; margin-bottom: 1em">
‡∞Ç ‡≤Ç ‡¥Ç ‡∂Ç ‡•¶ ‡©¶ ‡´¶ ‡Ø¶ ‡±¶ ‡≥¶ ‡µ¶ ‡πê ‡ªê ·ÅÄ ‚ÄéŸ•‚Äé €µ ÔΩè ‚Ñ¥ ùê® ùëú ùíê
ùì∏ ùî¨ ùï† ùñî ùóà ùóº ùò∞ ùô§ ùöò ·¥è ·¥ë Í¨Ω Œø ùõê ùúä ùùÑ ùùæ ùû∏ œÉ ùõî ùúé ùùà ùûÇ ùûº
‚≤ü –æ ·Éø ÷Ö ‚Äé◊°‚Äé ‚ÄéŸá‚Äé ‚Äéû∏§‚Äé ‚Äéûπ§‚Äé ‚Äéû∫Ñ‚Äé ‚ÄéÔª´‚Äé ‚ÄéÔª¨‚Äé Ôª™‚Äé ‚ÄéÔª©‚Äé ‚Äé⁄æ‚Äé ‚ÄéÔÆ¨‚Äé ‚ÄéÔÆ≠‚Äé ‚ÄéÔÆ´‚Äé ‚ÄéÔÆ™‚Äé ‚Äé€Å‚Äé ‚ÄéÔÆ®‚Äé ‚ÄéÔÆ©‚Äé ‚ÄéÔÆß‚Äé ‚ÄéÔÆ¶‚Äé
‚Äé€ï‚Äé ‡¥† ·Äù êì™ ë£à ë£ó êê¨
</div>

Detecting confusable characters is not built-in, it is possible with some gem support from **unicode-confusable**:

    require "unicode/confusable"
    Unicode::Confusable.confusable? "‚ÑúùòÇ·ñØ è", "Ruby" # => true

- [Unicode¬Æ Technical Standard #39: Unicode Security Mechanisms](https://unicode.org/reports/tr39/)
- [Gem: unicode-confusable](https://github.com/janlelis/unicode-confusable)

## Case-Mapping

Another Unicode topic is converting a word from lowercase to uppercase or vice versa. Up until Ruby 2.3, string methods like `#upcase`,`#capitalize`, `#downcase`, or `#swapcase` would just not work with non-ASCII characters:

    "√§".upcase # => "√§" # Ruby 2.3

This has been fixed and more recent versions of Ruby are able to do this out of the box:

    "√§".upcase # => "√Ñ"

The old, ASCII-only behavior can be achieved by passing the `:ascii` option:

    "√§".upcase(:ascii) # => "√§"

This is already much better than before, however, keep in mind that **case-mapping is a locale-dependent operation!** Not all languages use the same rules for converting between lower- and uppercase. For example, in most languages, the uppercase version of letter **i** is **I**:

    "i".upcase # => "I"

However, in Turkic languages, it's the letter `ƒ∞`:

    "i".upcase(:turkic) # => "ƒ∞"

Although Ruby supports special local case mapping rules, as of Ruby 2.5.1, only `:turkic` is supported. More options might be supported in the future.

- [Unicode¬Æ Standard Annex #44: Unicode Character Database / Section 5.6](https://unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Casemapping) (overview, see the respective sections in the [Unicode standard](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/UnicodeStandard-10.0.pdf) itself)
- [RDoc: String#downcase](https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#method-i-downcase)

### Special Case: Case-Folding

There is another special option that you can pass to the `String#downcase` method: The `:fold` symbol. It will turn on case-folding, which should be used instead of the default case-mapping behavior if you are interested in comparing/ordering strings. The case-folding algorithm might produce a different output than the case-mapping one. Fer example, the German letter *sharp s* should be treated like two normal *s* letters in comparisons:

    "·∫û".downcase # => "√ü"
    "·∫û".downcase(:fold) # => "ss"

There is another String method in Ruby core which makes use of case-folding: [String#casecmp?](https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#method-i-casecmp-3F)¬π which compares two strings ignoring their case:

     "A".casecmp? "a" # => true
     "·∫û".casecmp? "ss" # => true

¬π You should pay attention that its sister method [String#casecmp](https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#method-i-casecmp) only uses ASCII, despite the similar naming.

## Regex Unicode Property Matching

Ruby's regex engine supports matching of Unicode characteristics, like a characters general purpose (*general category*), its script, or in which codepoint range it is defined (*block*):

    "String, with: punctuation.".scan(/\p{P}/) # => [",", ":", "."]

See my previous articles for more details:

- [Episode 41: Proper Unicoding](/41-proper-unicoding.html) - More about the Unicode property syntax
- [Episode 30: Regex with Class](/30-regex-with-class.html) - Unicode behavior of regex matchers & POSIX-style character classes

### Special Case: Emoji Matching

Detecting emoji is especially complicated, because there are multiple mechanisms to build up the final emoji glyph. You can use the **unicode-emoji** gem to find all kinds of emoji:

    require "unicode/emoji"
    "üò¥ üõåüèΩ üáµüáπ ü§æüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è".scan(Unicode::Emoji::REGEX) # => ["üò¥", "üõåüèΩ", "üáµüáπ", "ü§æüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"]

- [Unicode¬Æ Technical Standard #51: Unicode Emoji](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/)
- [Gem: unicode-emoji](https://github.com/janlelis/unicode-emoji)

## Monospace Display-Width

Sometimes, you might find yourself in a situation where you would like to know the width of a character. But this is not easily possible, because the character width is just not defined! This, of course, leads to problems in fixed-width environments like terminals.

If you don't believe me, here are some wide characters for you to checkout:

Codepoint   | Glyph | Name
------------|-------|-----
**U+1242B** | íê´| CUNEIFORM NUMERIC SIGN NINE SHAR2
**U+12219** | íàô | CUNEIFORM SIGN LUGAL OPPOSING LUGAL
**U+A9C4**  | ÍßÑ    | JAVANESE PADA MADYA
**U+2E3B**  | ‚∏ª    | THREE-EM DASH
**U+2031**  | ‚Ä±     | PER TEN THOUSAND SIGN
{:.table-15-15-X}

To complicate things further, some Asian characters are marked as *ambiguous* and get displayed wide or narrow, depending on the software displaying them. The **unicode-display_width** can help:

    require "unicode/display_width"

    Unicode::DisplayWidth.of("‚öÄ") # => 1
    Unicode::DisplayWidth.of("‰∏Ä") # => 2

    # Ambiguous example
    Unicode::DisplayWidth.of("¬∑", 1) # => 1
    Unicode::DisplayWidth.of("¬∑", 2) # => 2

- [Unicode¬Æ Standard Annex #11: East Asian Width](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/tr11-33.html)
- [Gem: unicode-display_width](https://github.com/janlelis/unicode-display_width)

## Unicode Special Codepoints

The last section will put the focus on four types of codepoints that require some attention. This is just a selection, there are many more notable codepoints and a good starting point to dig deeper is the [Awesome Codepoints](https://github.com/Codepoints/awesome-codepoints) list!

### Invalid Codepoints

There are two kinds of codepoints which are invalid. If you have these in your data, the data is invalid and [String#valid_encoding?](https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#method-i-valid_encoding-3F) will return false. Both of them are encoding-related:

*UTF-16 Surrogates*

The four byte mechanism that ***UTF-16*** uses to represent codepoints higher than **U+FFFF** (= 65 535) needs auxiliary codepoints. These are **U+D800..U+DFFF** and they are strictly forbidden in ***UTF-8*** and ***UTF-32***.

*Too Large Codepoints*

Any codepoint above **U+10FFFF** (= 1 114 111) is not allowed. The theoretical **UTF-32** maximum is **U+FFFFFFFF** (= 4 294 967 295) and four byte **UTF-8** could represent codepoints upto **U+1FFFFF** (= 2 097 151).

Ruby does not let you create these from literals:

    "\u{D800}" # => SyntaxError: (irb):52: invalid Unicode codepoint
    "\u{110000}" # => SyntaxError: (irb):54: invalid Unicode codepoint (too large)

But, if you really need to‚Ä¶, you can [use Array#pack](/4-what-the-pack.html):

    [0xD800].pack("U") # => "\xED\xA0\x80"
    [0x110000].pack("U") # => "\xF4\x90\x80\x80"

Ruby also includes a useful method that removes all invalid bytes, for example, surrogates:

    "a\xED\xA0\x80b" # => "a\xED\xA0\x80b"
    "a\xED\xA0\x80b".scrub # => "aÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩb"
    "a\xED\xA0\x80b".scrub("") # => "ab"

### Unstandardized Codepoints

Another group of codepoints that require extra care are the unstandardized ones. When you look at the following diagram, you will see that a lot of codepoints actually do not have a meaning assigned by the consortium (yet):

#### Codepoint Distribution as of Unicode 10

<svg id="codepoints" style="margin-bottom: 1em; max-width: 100%" width="670" height="397" viewBox="0 0 670 397" preserveAspectRatio="none" onload="renderDiagram(dataCodepointsAssignment, 'codepoints')"></svg>

#### Types of Unstandardized Codepoints

- **Private-Use Codepoints:** Meant for custom allocations by anyone. You will find vendor logos here, for example, **U+F8FF** for the Apple logo "Ô£ø" and **U+F200** for the ubuntu logo "ÔàÄ". Both may only display correctly on the respective operating system with a proper font). Other uses of the private plane include assigning codepoints to fantasy languages like [Tengwar by J.R.R. Tolkien](http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/).
- **Non-Characters:** A handful of codepoints that will never be assigned. Different than invalid codepoints, they are allowed to be used in your data. But they have no meaning.
- **Reserved Codepoints:** Will (or might) be assigned in a later version of Unicode

Type           | Count    | Codepoints   | Ruby Regex
---------------|----------|--------------|-----------
Private-Use    | 137 468¬π | **U+E000..U+F8FF**, **U+F0000..U+FFFFD**, **U+100000..U+10FFFD**                       | `/\p{private use}`

¬π Two additional private-use codepoints are **U+0091** and **U+0092**, but they are counted as control characters (see next section)

### Control Characters

For historical reasons Unicode includes a set of 65 control codepoints. They were not defined by the Unicode Consortium and a lot of them are not universally standardized. However, some of them are extremely common, such as **U+0009**, the [tab-stop character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_stop). It also contains the newline characters **U+0010** "\n" and **U+0013** "\r"; depending on your operating system, use one or both of them for [a newline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline).

Control characters are divided into the two sections ***C0***, covering **U+0000..U+001F**, and ***C1***, covering **U+0080..U+009F**. Furthermore, the [delete character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delete_character) **U+007F** ‚ê° is also considered to be a control character.

In regexes, you can match for control characters with `\p{control}` or just `\p{cc}`.

¬π The *NEXT LINE* control character was introduced to have an universal codepoint for [newlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline). This goal was not reached. Still, on some systems (for example, my ubuntu machine), it will actually create a newline!

The **characteristics** gem lets you check if a codepoint belongs to a specific control group:

    Characteristics.create("\u{80}").c0? # => false
    Characteristics.create("\u{80}").c1? # => true

- [Wikipedia has more info on every control codepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes)
- [Gem: characteristics](https://github.com/janlelis/characteristics)

### Ignorable Codepoints

My last example of special codepoints are the so called ignorable codepoints. Their meaning varies, but most of them are invisible and they are often not treated as a whitespace by Unicode. They are ignorable in the sense that if your Unicode rendering engine does not know how to display it, it should *just display nothing*. The ignorable property is even given to some ranges of *unassigned* codepoints¬π (which is usually not done).

You can check for ignorable codepoints using the `/\p{default ignorable code point}/` (or its shorthand `\p{di}`) regex.

For example, the following piece of code is made out of [tag characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tags_(Unicode_block)), which resemble all [ASCII characters](/56-us-ascii-8bit.html), but as ignorable characters:

    eval "Û†Å∞Û†ÅµÛ†Å¥Û†Å≥Û†Ä†Û†ÄßÛ†ÅâÛ†Å§Û†Å©Û†ÅØÛ†Å≥Û†ÅπÛ†ÅÆÛ†Å£Û†Å≤Û†Å°Û†Å¥Û†Å©Û†Å£Û†Ä†Û†ÅïÛ†ÅÆÛ†Å©Û†Å£Û†ÅØÛ†Å§Û†Å•Û†Äß".codepoints.map{ |c| c - 0xE0000 }.pack("U*")

This program will output `Idiosyncratic Unicode`

¬π The whole range of **E0000..E0FFF** is ignorable!

## CLI Tools for Codepoint Analysis

I hope that you are now ready to closely inspect your own Unicode data! To help you do so, I made a few command-line tools, I hope you like them:

- [uniscribe](https://github.com/janlelis/uniscribe) for codepoint analysis
- [unibits](https://github.com/janlelis/unibits) for encoding analysis, also supports a lot of non-Unicode encodings
- [unicopy](https://github.com/janlelis/unicopy) for converting & copying codepoints
